Research on my new home at 513 N Hermitage Ave.
<br />
<br />
After some research, I discovered that my current home that was built 2 years ago, stands on the ground of what was the 
Grand Street station of the now defunct Metropolitan West Side Elevated Railroad. The Met West was a 3.6 mile elevated train 
that we eventually part of the CTA Blue Line. The Met West was built in 1895 and was in operation until 1958.
