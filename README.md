The Met West Grand station (no image availabe) was the same style as the Blue Line Damen station pictured above

Research on my new home at 513 N Hermitage Ave.</h1> <br> <br> After some research, I discovered that my current home that was built 2 years ago, stands on the ground of what was the Grand Street station of the now defunct Metropolitan West Side Elevated Railroad. The Met West was a 3.6 mile elevated train that eventually became part of the CTA Blue Line. The Met West was built in 1895 and was in
operation until 1958.
