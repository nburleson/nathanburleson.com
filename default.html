It&#8217;s beyond ridiculous.</p>    <p>I am very much convinced that the founders of wing chun were a <strong>team</strong> of people with some profound knowledge of human physiology.<br></p>    <p>It is probably hard-wired into the human brain to listen to stories and memorize them well. Before we developed scripture, knowledge and myths had to be transmitted orally. In story-form it was easy to remember.</p>    <p>But of course orally transmitted stories would change after a while &#8211; just like in the telephone game. Suddenly an average Jane might turn into a superhero.</p>    <p>The Chinese understood very well the impact of telling a story &#8211; it&#8217;s no accident that nowadays storytelling is among the most hyped marketing tactics. </p>    <p>So what if all the stories about Yip Man are stories made up (or sometimes exaggerated with a tiny spark of truth in them). Just to sell the wing chun product better. To intimidate other styles and make the stories more memorable.</p>    <h2>Yip Man as superhero &#8211; what&#8217;s the evidence?<br></h2>    <p>If we take the actual evidence about Yip Man all at least I can see is an average person with hardly any understanding of Siu Nim Tao &#8211; at least no understanding that goes beyond what other &#8220;masters&#8221; do and show. </p>    <p>I am pretty sure that if you put Yip Man among other men in Hongkong&#8217;s Kungfu-Corner, let him practice Siu Nim Tao, and you didn&#8217;t know it&#8217;s Yip Man you wouldn&#8217;t recognize him as some the superhuman fighter he&#8217;s always depicted.</p>    <div><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="426" src="https://secret-siunimtao.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/38374648244_9dc35784e7_z.jpg" alt="Yip Man in Kungfu Corner - not quite!" srcset="https://secret-siunimtao.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/38374648244_9dc35784e7_z.jpg 640w, https://secret-siunimtao.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/38374648244_9dc35784e7_z-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></figure></div>    <p> Just look at the videos of Yip Man practicing Siu Nim Tao. You could now argue that he was quite old and sick at this point. I get that. But I bet it would have not looked any different 30 years before.</p>    <p>Yip Man shows that he had not understood <a href="https://secret-siunimtao.com/">what Siu Nim Tao is about</a>.</p>    <p>Just to set the record straight: I am not trying to belittle Yip Man or any of the other protagonists. All I am saying is that if we want to advance we can&#8217;t believe made-up stories or just copy and do what has been handed down through the decades or even centuries. </p>    <p>We have to think for ourselves with the knowledge and the tools we have.</p>    <p>If you want to learn more:</p>    <p style="text-align: center;"><a class="bookButton" title="Book Secret Siu Nim Tao on Amazon" href="http://bit.ly/SiuNimTao">Buy the book</a> <a class="bookButton" title="Online-Course Secret Siu Nim Tao on Teachable" href="http://bit.ly/SiuNimTao-Course">Take the course</a></p>    <p><strong>Picture Credits</strong>: Udo Butschinek, Creative Commons<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Picture Credits: Udo Butschinek, Creative Commons BY-ND 4.0  (Ã¶ffnet in neuem Tab)" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0" target="_blank"> BY-ND 4.0</a><br></p> </div>     <script src="assets/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script> </body>  </html>
